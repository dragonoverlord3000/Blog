## Problem
Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $U$ is a subspace of $V$ such that $\dim U = \dim V$. Prove that $U = V$.

## Solution
$\dim U = \dim V$ implies that a basis of $U$ consist of $\dim V$ linearly independent vectors $u_1, \dots, u_{\dim V}$, but as $U \subseteq V$ all the $u_i$'s are in $V$. The list $u_1, \dots, u_{\dim V}$ is therefore a linearly independent list in $V$ of the right length i.e. a basis - as per theorem 2.39.
