## Problem
Prove that $\mathbb{F}^\infty$ is infinite dimensional

## Solution
Construct the infinite sequence of linearly independent vectors in $\mathbb{F}^\infty$ $(1,0,0,\dots), (0,1,0,\dots), \dots$ where the $j$'th vector in the sequence has a one in the $j$'th coordinate and zeros everywhere else.

The existence of such a sequence then implies, by [P2A14](https://dragonoverlord3000.github.io/posts/linear_algebra/ladr/chapter2/exercise-2a-problem-8/), that $\mathbb{F}^\infty$ is infinite dimensional.
