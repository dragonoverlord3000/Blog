## Problem
Prove that the union of three subspaces of $V$ is a subspace of $V$if and only if one of the subspaces is contained in the other.

## Solution
$(\leftarrow)$ The case where one of the three subsets contain one of the other was handled in [P1C12](https://dragonoverlord3000.github.io/posts/linear_algebra/ladr/chapter1/exercise-1c-problem-12/). Therefore we can assume that the three subspaces, denoted $U_1$, $U_2$ and $U_3$ from here on out, each have elements that aren't in the union of the other two sets - see this figure:
