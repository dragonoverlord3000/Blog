## Problem
Prove that $-(-v) = v$ for every $v \in V$

## Solution
By direct computation:
$$-(-v) \stackrel{T1.31}{=} (-1)(-v) \stackrel{T1.31}{=} (-1)\left((-1)v\right) \stackrel{P1A13}{=} \left((-1)(-1)\right)v = 1v \stackrel{D1.19}{=} v$$
Proving that the additive inverse of an additive inverse of $v$ is $v$ itself.
