## Problem
The empty set is not a vector space. The empty set fails to satisfy only one of the requirements listed in 1.19. Which one?

## Solution
Definition 1.19 requires that there exists an additive identity $0 \in V$, but as there are no elements in the empty set, this requirement is not satisfied by the empty set.
